🚀 AI-Powered Learning Project: Fleet Manager App
Note: This is a personal learning project where I'm using AI assistance to accelerate my development process while ensuring I understand and implement all concepts.

🎯 Learning Objectives
Master Angular framework and best practices

Deepen Python FastAPI backend development skills

Understand full-stack application architecture

Learn PostgreSQL database design and optimization

Practice JWT authentication and security

Implement real-world business logic

Develop problem-solving skills with AI collaboration

🤖 My Development Approach
I'm using AI to:

Accelerate boilerplate code generation

Get instant feedback on best practices

Debug and optimize code efficiently

Learn industry standards faster

Focus on understanding concepts rather than syntax

Important: All code is reviewed, understood, and customized by me to ensure genuine learning.

# 🚗 Fleet Manager App

A full-stack web application designed to manage vehicles, drivers, trips, and maintenance schedules for fleet operations. This project demonstrates strong skills in Angular for the frontend and FastAPI with SQLite for the backend.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Master Angular framework and best practices.
- Deepen understanding of FastAPI backend development.
- Learn full-stack architecture and RESTful API design.
- Build efficient and scalable SQLite databases.
- Implement JWT authentication and user authorization.
- Apply real-world business logic in fleet management scenarios.
- Practice end-to-end problem-solving and optimization skills.
